# ðŸš€ GitHub Upload Commands - UPDATED

# Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME with your actual GitHub details

# Step 1: Add remote origin (run this after creating the repository on GitHub)

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Step 2: Push to GitHub

git push -u origin main

# Example with real details:

# git remote add origin https://github.com/MA82F/fastapi-feedback-collector.git

# git push -u origin main

# ðŸŽ¯ WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:

# Once you push, GitHub Actions will automatically:

# âœ… Run tests on Python 3.11 and 3.12

# âœ… Perform code quality checks (flake8, black, isort, mypy)

# âœ… Run security scans (bandit, safety)

# âœ… Build and test Docker image

# âœ… Generate coverage reports

# The CI/CD pipeline should now work without dependency conflicts! ðŸŽ‰
